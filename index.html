  i'm a old programmer, 41 years old, living in beijing, china. 
  10 years ago，i gave up c++ and java, development server service use c on unix system. 
  recently, i suddenly want to test c++, so i saw c++11. 
  10 years ago, c++ is a standard oop language，
  today it's more looks like a super macro language. i like it.
</p>
<p>
  two weeks ago, i started learning c++11, and try to write some templates.
  those day, i'm hovering between standard and assembled, just like a clumsy penguin began my journey
</p>
<p>
  using english to express my thinking, really difficult. 
  if anybody can help me, let's me say it more concise, i'm very grateful.

  libll++ is a c++ network development library, using c++11. however, it is not just concerned about network development, 
  it is built on the basis of a specific application development components. those components are concepts from c. 
  libll++ is my learning project, it's code from variety of open source software and web forums.
  i'll try to explain each piece of code come from where in this blog.
  but if you want to use it, please observe the original copyright.
