<p>first, so sorry, my english is really sucks. 
i had to use google translator to translate my every word. 
I try to remember these statements and words, I'm going with my son to complete these blog.</p>

<p>
i'm a old programmer, 41 years old, living in beijing, china. 
10 years ago，i gave up c++ and java, development server service use c on unix system. 
recently, i suddenly want to test c++, so i saw c++11. 
10 years ago, c++ is a standard oop language，
today it's more looks like a super macro language. i like it.
</p>
<p>
two weeks ago, i started learning c++11, and try to write some templates.
those day, i'm hovering between standard and assembled, just like a clumsy penguin began my journey
</p>
<p>
using english to express my thinking, really difficult. 
if anybody can help me, let's me say it more concise, i'm very grateful.
</p>
